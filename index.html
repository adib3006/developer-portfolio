            <h3>Dream Big and Work Hard</h3>
            <p>Dreaming big is easy but achieving them is rather hard. I love to travel and explore the world around me. But that doesn't pay my bills. That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.</p>

            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p id="dream-big-text">I've done developing a quizgame based website as project during my B.Sc. degree. Again I am sharpening my skills and learn new things from programming-Hero course. I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my grandma how to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.</p>
